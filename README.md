# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As a [Sports Agent], <br> 
> I want to [to recruit college level players from a sport at a selected college], <br> 
> so that I can [ figure out what sport & division to recruit from for the next level in their career.]. 

## Dataset  

Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mlorvnrAkWYEwaKYHUupAKE1Mf5TF23J5u1woYQ3s8g/edit?usp=sharing

- **School_Name** (String) - name of the college/university 
- **Sport_Name** (String) - the name of the sports at that school
- **Division** (int) - the division of that sport at selected school

## Description 

Our project uses the data from said files. Selects a name of a school that is available. Then goes through a list of sports played at that school. After selecting both a school and a sport, the code will contiue to find the division for that sport and prints it out in the console.
